# Aspect Extraction for Hotel Reviews: A Hybrid Approach - Capstone Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Capstone Project in National College of Ireland, which focuses on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) in the hotel domain using Python in a Jupyter Notebook format.

## Project Overview

This project addresses a significant challenge in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP): the scarcity of labelled data for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) in the hotel industry. ABSA aims to extract and analyze specific aspects (e.g., cleanliness, location, service) from textual data, providing more granular insights than traditional sentiment analysis.

### Objectives

1. **Aspect Identification:** Develop a hybrid approach combining vocabulary-based techniques with machine learning for aspect identification in hotel reviews.
2. **Data Set Creation:** Utilize a large dataset of 32,449 English language TripAdvisor reviews of Vietnamese hotels to create a labelled dataset with seven distinct aspect categories.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train and evaluate various machine learning models, including Multinomial Logistic Regression, SGD Classifier, and Na√Øve Bayes, to classify sentiments associated with each identified aspect.
4. **Performance Assessment:** Assess the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving the best performance with 68% accuracy.

### Key Findings

- The hybrid approach successfully identified seven aspect categories relevant to hotel reviews.
- The labelled dataset enabled effective training and evaluation of sentiment classification models.
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 68%.
- The study highlights the potential of aspect identification for understanding consumer behavior and improving hotel management strategies.

### Future Work

- Explore advanced language models (e.g., BERT, GPT) to improve aspect-based sentiment analysis.
- Expand the dataset to include reviews from hotels in other countries and in multiple languages to generalize the findings.

## Repository Contents

- **Data:** Contains the processed dataset of TripAdvisor reviews used for model training and evaluation.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks documenting the entire process, including data preprocessing, aspect identification, model training, evaluation, and results visualization.
- **Scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Presentation:** A brief overview of the methodology, experiments, results, and analysis.

## Usage
This repository is intended for researchers, data scientists, and developers interested in NLP and sentiment analysis within the hospitality and tourism domain. The notebooks and scripts can be adapted to analyze sentiment in different domains or languages.
